	ISSN = {13507265},
	URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/25464774},
	abstract = {In extreme-value analysis, a central topic is the adaptive estimation of the extreme-value index γ. Hitherto, most of the attention in this area has been devoted to the case γ > 0, that is, when F̄ is a regularly varying function with index -1/γ. In addition to the well-known Hill estimator, many other estimators are currently available. Among the most important are the kernel-type estimators and the weighted least-squares slope estimators based on the Pareto quantile plot or the Zipf plot, as reviewed by Csörgő and Viharos. Using an exponential regression model (ERM) for spacings between successive extreme order statistics, both Beirlant et al. and Feuerverger and Hall introduced bias-reduced estimators. For the case where γ is real, Hill's estimator has been generalized to a moment-type estimator by Dekkers et al. Alternatively, Beirlant et al. introduced a Hill-type estimator that is based on the generalized quantile plot. Another popular estimation method follows from maximum likelihood estimation applied to the generalizations of the Pareto distribution. In the present paper, slope estimators for γ > 0 are generalized to the case where γ is real-valued. This is accomplished by replacing the Zipf plot by a generalized quantile plot. We make an asymptotic comparison of our estimator with the moment estimator and with the maximum likelihood estimator. A case study illustrates our findings. Finally, we offer a regression model that generalizes the ERM in that it allows the construction of bias-reduced estimators. Moreover, the model provides an adaptive selection rule for the number of extremes needed in several of the existing estimators.},

	URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2951449},
	abstract = {The tail index of a density has been widely used as an indicator of the probability of getting a large deviation in a random variable. Most of the theory underlying popular estimators of it assume that the data are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, many recent applications of the estimator have been to financial data, and such data tend to exhibit long-range dependence. We show, via Monte Carlo simulations, that conventional measures of the precision of the estimator, which are based on the i.i.d. assumption, are greatly exaggerated when such dependent data are used. This conclusion also has implications for estimates of the likelihood of getting some extreme values, and we illustrate the changed conclusions one would get using equity return data.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the asymptotic distributional theory of extreme values for a wide class of dependent stochastic sequences and continuous parameter processes. The theory contains the standard classical extreme value results for maxima and extreme order statistics as special cases but is richer on account of the diverse behavior possible under dependence in both discrete and continuous time contexts. Emphasis is placed on stationary cases but some departures from stationarity are considered. Significant ideas and methods are described rather than details, and, in particular, the nature and role of important underlying point processes (such as exceedances and upcrossings) are emphasized. Applications are given to particular classes of processes (e.g., normal, moving average) and connections with related theory (such as convergence of sums) are indicated.},
