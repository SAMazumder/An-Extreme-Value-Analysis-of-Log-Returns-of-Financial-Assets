Anything I have on my computer when writing my undergrad thesis. Mostly having to do with limiting distributions of financial instruments.

I make no claims to the originality or the correctness of the code used in the analysis. I do however claim the thesis itself is original, insofar as one can have original research as an undergrad.


# ABSTRACT
This thesis presents a study of extreme movements in financial asset returns. According to Extreme Value Theory, the distribution of an extreme financial asset return obeys a
FrÂ´echet distribution. Such a distribution of extreme realizations depend on the characterization of the tail of the distribution of the asset return. We investigate this tail behaviour
by the Hill method for estimating the heaviness of the tail.
Using data from a random collection of stocks and indexes, we show empirically that
financial asset returns have characteristics that preclude the log-normal assumption of
distribution of prices in the Black-Scholes model. Furthermore, we show that the distribution of asset returns skew away from the mean and such a distribution has heavy tails.
Hence, asset returns will have extreme realizations with greater probability that predicted
by Black-Scholes model.
